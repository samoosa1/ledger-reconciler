/**
 * OCR for scanned invoices, in the browser, with tesseract.js.
 *
 * pdf.js renders page 1 to a canvas; tesseract reads it. The worker,
 * WebAssembly core and English language data are fetched on first use
 * only, so a visitor who never drops a scan never pays for them. Files
 * still never leave the browser: recognition runs in a local Web Worker.
 *
 * Mirrors extract.ocr_pdf_text: the untouched raster goes first, because
 * tesseract's own binarisation copes with a clean desk scan better than a
 * hand-rolled threshold does with thin type. There is no deskew here; the
 * Python side found it rarely helped once speckle was handled.
